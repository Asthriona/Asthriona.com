# Hello World V4!

Hi, It's been a while! Lots of stuff happened, and so many new things were planned for the V3. The `dev` branch was full of new stuff, and even more on `asthriona.space`. Sadly, life happened, and I never was able to release the new updates. an issue similar to `Yukiko.app` The website was down for a while.

So one evening, I decided to get rid of the back-end, and try something "new". So i set up a new project still using Vue, but this time with Nuxt!

I always wanted to know if I liked it or not. I have yet to mess around with the "back-end" part of it and see what cool stuff I can do with it. Â 

## So you said Nuxt?

Yeah I did! I choose Nuxt because last time I tried it, the thing was probably in V2, and I wanted to try that @nuxt/content I've heard about for a long time now.
So now no only I can write my posts in Markdown on obsidian, but also I don't have to use any database to store them! so i get rid of the back-end, which was also used to be a link between the database, and the website, but also the database itself is gone. 
This means, No more account either. I might bring that back probably using GitHub as provider, and the API to comment on posts or something.  
I still havent decided that. I'm still figuring out the blogs style.  
I mean `this` was still black 2 minutes ago, barely visible. 
if you notice something wrong, maybe wait until the next posts, maybe I'll fix it by then. Using the product is the best way to find bugs! and users.
The goal here is to explore new things, I want to learn new languages, but i'm too lazy, and I'm pretty much quitting Developement to move into car stuff.  
so switching to a new framework (new to me) is I think a good way to keep things interesting while I wait for a slot for training in my new feild!  
I will keep this website going, and update it as much as I can, and when I feel like it, but honestly programing is boring me a lot.  
It was fun when it was to keep my head busy, but now, is not the same.  
it made me meet great friends, and I'm glad we still can have fun together via some other common interst.  
I will still be greatfull to those friends who helped me a lot on those projects and life in general.  
  
## What's next for this?  
To be honest I have no idea, I'm working on it as I go, I want to learn the back-end of Nuxt so maybe that's next. Using a database or something like that to make the website more dynamic. I need to figure out the Twitter cards too.  
But the blog will be the main part of this website, as I said, I really like the "old" internet, where blogs were everywhere, and I want this website to be a modern version of that. Maybe bring back those blogs, and inspire others to make their own.  
Sure you don't have to make it full custom like me, but as I always say, if you are passionate about something, and can write about it, Make a blog. Write about it. I don't say that you will be read by many, but someone, someday might find your content usefull. and imo that's what's internet is about. 


## Why is the background so dark? 
I like it, reflect my ***soul***...  
Just kidding, I like OLED screens, and dark theme, so I optimized my website for that. 
After all, the point of having fully custom software is to make it yours. 
  
Alrighty! That's is for now, see you later! 
And here take this song I like before you go!

# Hello World V4!

Hi, It's been a while! Lots of stuff happened, and so many new things were planned for the V3. The `dev` branch was full of new stuff, and even more on `asthriona.space`. Sadly, life happened, and I never was able to release the new updates. an issue similar to `Yukiko.app` The website was down for a while.

So one evening, I decided to get rid of the back-end, and try something "new". So i set up a new project still using Vue, but this time with Nuxt!

I always wanted to know if I liked it or not. I have yet to mess around with the "back-end" part of it and see what cool stuff I can do with it. Â 

## So you said Nuxt?

Yeah I did! I choose Nuxt because last time I tried it, the thing was probably in V2, and I wanted to try that @nuxt/content I've heard about for a long time now.
So now no only I can write my posts in Markdown on obsidian, but also I don't have to use any database to store them! so i get rid of the back-end, which was also used to be a link between the database, and the website, but also the database itself is gone. 
This means, No more account either. I might bring that back probably using GitHub as provider, and the API to comment on posts or something.  
I still havent decided that. I'm still figuring out the blogs style.  
I mean `this` was still black 2 minutes ago, barely visible. 
if you notice something wrong, maybe wait until the next posts, maybe I'll fix it by then. Using the product is the best way to find bugs! and users.

**Introduction:**

Celestial Sphere is committed to fair and competitive racing.  We believe in upholding the spirit of sportsmanship and believe that all drivers deserve a chance to succeed based on their skill and preparation. 

**Recent Unfairness in Recent HECS RJP Memorial 400k Incidents:**

During the past two oval races, Celestial Sphere has encountered situations that raise concerns about the current fairness and consistency of the racing environment. These include:

* **Incident 1:** No caution for one car spin.
* **Incident 2:** Uncalled caution for one car spin with 2 or more cars involved.
* **Incident 3**: Untaken action for multiple rules violation and involvement in incident 2.

**Impact on Competition:**

These incidents have significantly impacted Celestial Sphere's ability to compete fairly and have led to frustration and disappointment. 

**Taking a Stand:**

Celestial Sphere is committed to fair racing and believes that change is necessary. We are taking the following actions:

* **Retirement from Oval Races:**  Effective immediately, Celestial Sphere will not be participating in future oval races until the concerns outlined above are addressed. 
* **Strategic Use of Loyalty Points:**  We will be strategically utilizing the existing loyalty point system to minimize penalties for not participating in oval races.
* **"Fight for Fair Racing" Livery Sticker:**  We have added a "Fight for Fair Racing" sticker to our car livery. This sticker features three skulls as strike marks, representing the number of unfair incidents we are willing to tolerate before considering further action. Currently, one strike is filled. 
* **Retirement from testing/practice sessions:** Additionally, Celestial Sphere will no longer be participating in voluntary testing or practice sessions for **any races**. We believe our time and resources are best spent focusing on other areas until the fairness and consistency concerns across all races are addressed.

**Loyalty Points and Fairness:**

Team Celestial Sphere, along with other teams, has raised concerns about the current loyalty point system within HECS. This system awards full last-place points (84 pts) to drivers who do not participate in a race. While we understand the potential intent of such a system might be to encourage participation and keep the field competitive across the season, it creates an unfair advantage for those with lower attendance.

As an example, let's consider two drivers over a 10-race week:

- **Driver A:** Consistently attends all races (100% attendance) and finishes in an average 11th place (85 pts/race). This driver would earn a total of 850 points (10 races * 85 pts/race).
- **Driver B:** Attends only 7 races (70% attendance) but achieves a mid-pack average finish of 8th place (88 pts/race) when attending. However, Driver B also receives full last-place points (84 pts) for the missed races. In this scenario, Driver B accumulates 868 points (7 races * 88 pts/race) + (3 missed races * 84 pts/race).

This demonstrates that a driver with lower attendance can potentially outrank a more consistent driver under the current system. We believe a more balanced approach to loyalty points is necessary to ensure fair competition and reward consistent participation.

**Alternative Solutions:**

We are open to discussing alternative solutions that address the concerns outlined above. Here are a few suggestions:

- **Reduced Loyalty Points:** Awarding a reduced point value (e.g., 50% of last place points) for missed races would incentivize participation while maintaining a ranking advantage for consistent drivers.
- **Minimum Participation Requirement:** Establish a minimum participation threshold (e.g., 70% of races) to qualify for year-end championship points.

**Call to Action:**

Celestial Sphere encourages all drivers and league officials to engage in constructive dialogue about creating a more fair and consistent racing environment. We believe that by working together, we can ensure a better experience for all participants.

**Conclusion:**

Celestial Sphere remains dedicated to competitive racing and looks forward to continuing our participation in road course races within HECS. We are confident that by raising these concerns, we can contribute to a positive and fair racing environment for everyone.

**Thank you.**

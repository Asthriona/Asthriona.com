        Since they decided that Discord was the best place to give us informations about what's going on, instead of traditional social media/Status page, 
        I'm unaware of what's up or when will it be fixed. In the mean time, check my profile <a href="https://anilist.co/user/Asthriona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Asthriona</a>
      </p>

        This is a very personal opinion, but honestly, if you have Github, Twitter, Facebook, Your own forum and everything you ever wanted... <br />
        Don't limit those kind of information to just Your discord.
        I got it you want it to grow, but people will join, read what's up and leave. we have enough server as is. <br />
        Don't be like them. Be open on comunication. <br />
        rant over.

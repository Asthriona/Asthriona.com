            <b>Welcome to my Website!</b> <br />
            I am Asthriona, or Makoto, call me as you wish. I'm a full-stack

              >Rainboom Studio</a
            >. Living in france at the moment, I'll move to UK in a few months
            for a while and then hopefully Japan. I'm a big fan of the japanese
            culture, and learning the language. When not coding, I like to work
            on cars, Drifting is in my blood. Also Video games, I play those
            since I'm able to hold a controler, or use a mouse as my first game
            was Minesweeper on Windows 95.
